# hummingbird
A tiny yet smart PHP framework

Hummingbird is a framework with the concept using Registrar to register components into the Container, then use Accessor to lookup or invoke the component from Container while the Registrar and the Accessor are also components so you can register your own registrars and accessors. With this idea, you can extend the framework flexibly.
